# KanjiCount

## Usage:
`python3 kanjicount.py "{insert string here}"`

## What does it do?
- For each character in a given string, it makes a list of unique characters in that string, and skips over hiragana and katakana characters, as well as spaces and newlines
- It prints a list of the unique characters, plus a total count

## What to use this for?
- If you keep track of your vocabulary while learning Japanese, you can simply paste a string containing all vocab words you know and this script will tell you how many kanji you've learned!
- If you want to know how difficult an article is to read, you can paste the whole article in and find out how many unique kanji it has!
